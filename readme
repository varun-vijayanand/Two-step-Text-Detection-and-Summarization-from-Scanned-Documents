This is my implementation of my project "Text Detection and Summarization from Scanned Documents" that uses 
Open CV and TextRank Algorithm to first identify the text from a pdf by converting it into a picture and then subsequently performing 
Text Summarization on it to give a short summary.

How to run the file:
1. Download sample.pdf
2. clone/copy the code
3. run the code
